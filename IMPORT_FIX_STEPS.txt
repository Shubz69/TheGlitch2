FIX: NO TABLES CREATED - The error is blocking table creation

SOLUTION 1: Use Data Import with Error Handling (EASIEST)
1. In MySQL Workbench, go to Server → Data Import/Restore
2. Select "Import from Self-Contained File"
3. Choose your SQL file
4. IMPORTANT: Check the box "Continue on SQL errors" or "Skip errors"
5. Click "Start Import"
6. This will create tables even if cleanup code fails

SOLUTION 2: Manually Edit SQL Files (MORE WORK)
1. Open each SQL file in a text editor
2. Find and DELETE these lines at the END of each file:
   /*!40111 SET SQL_NOTES=@OLD_SQL_NOTES */;
   /*!40103 SET TIME_ZONE=@OLD_TIME_ZONE */;
   /*!40101 SET SQL_MODE=@OLD_SQL_MODE */;
3. Keep everything else (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, etc.)
4. Save and import again

SOLUTION 3: Run SQL in Query Tab (RECOMMENDED)
1. In MySQL Workbench, open a new SQL tab
2. Type: USE railway;
3. Execute it
4. For each SQL file:
   - Open the SQL file in a text editor
   - Copy ONLY the CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements
   - Paste into MySQL Workbench
   - Execute
   - Skip the cleanup SET statements at the end

RECOMMENDED: Use Solution 1 - it's the fastest!
