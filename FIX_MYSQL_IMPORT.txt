FIX FOR "No database selected" ERROR:

The SQL files don't specify which database to use. Here's how to fix:

OPTION 1: Select Database First (EASIEST)
1. In MySQL Workbench, connect to Railway MySQL
2. In the left sidebar (Navigator), find "SCHEMAS"
3. Double-click "railway" to set it as default
4. Or right-click "railway" → "Set as Default Schema"
5. Now try importing again - it should work!

OPTION 2: Use Import Script
Run: import_railway.bat
It automatically specifies the database name

OPTION 3: Manual SQL Import
1. In MySQL Workbench, open a SQL query tab
2. Type: USE railway;
3. Then for each SQL file:
   - Go to File → Open SQL Script
   - Select the SQL file
   - Click "Execute" button (lightning bolt icon)

RECOMMENDED: Use Option 1 (set railway as default schema)
