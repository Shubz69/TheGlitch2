VERIFY IF YOUR DATA WAS IMPORTED:

In MySQL Workbench:
1. Make sure you're connected to Railway MySQL
2. In the left sidebar, expand "SCHEMAS" → "railway"
3. Click the refresh icon (circular arrow) next to "Tables"
4. You should see tables like:
   - channel_model
   - channels
   - courses
   - users
   - messages
   - etc.

If you see the tables, the import worked! The error is just from cleanup code at the end.

TO FIX THE ERROR (optional):
The error is from this line at the end of SQL files:
/*!40111 SET SQL_NOTES=@OLD_SQL_NOTES */;

You can either:
1. Ignore it (data is already imported)
2. Or comment out/remove that line from SQL files before importing

NEXT STEPS:
1. Verify tables exist (see above)
2. Add Vercel environment variables
3. Redeploy Vercel
4. Test registration!
