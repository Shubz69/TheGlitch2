QUICK FIX: The SQL files are looking for database "trading_platform" but Railway uses "railway"

SOLUTION 1: Create trading_platform database (RECOMMENDED)
1. In MySQL Workbench, open a new SQL tab
2. Type and execute:
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS trading_platform;
3. Now try importing again - it should work!

SOLUTION 2: Change Vercel to use trading_platform
After creating the database, update Vercel environment variables:
MYSQL_DATABASE = trading_platform (instead of railway)

SOLUTION 3: Skip import, use auto-create (FASTEST)
Your code auto-creates tables on first use!
1. Just add Vercel environment variables with:
   MYSQL_DATABASE = railway
2. Redeploy Vercel
3. Try registering - it will auto-create users table
4. Import your existing data later if needed

RECOMMENDED: Solution 1 - Create the database, then import
